        <p> I am a very passionate and caring person. I am driven by success and the idea of a great and promising future for not only myself but for my family as well. 
            I grew up in Willis, Texas and later moved to Houston where I met my partner. We moved to San Francisco and I became an EMT.<br><br>
            I started learning American Sign Language in early 2018 and currently still. I have found that language to be beautiful as well as useful 
            in situations.<br>
            <br>
            I am currently in this bootcamp to learn about web development. Working as an EMT I realized that I enjoy solving puzzels and fixing things, and it's also very clear that the future is tech and I need to hop on board before its too late.
            A week in and i'm a little lost but catching up everyday and loving every bit of it.<br>
            <br>
            My hobbies include spending time with my family, video games, skateboarding, and relaxing. I work hard so my dog can live a happy life.
