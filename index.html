                    <p> I a a very passionate and caring person. I am driven by success and the idea of a great and
                        promising
                        future for not only myself but for my family as well.
                        I grew up in Willis, Texas and later moved to Houston where I met my partner. We moved to San
                        Francisco
                        and I became an EMT.<br>
                        <br>
                        I started learning American Sign Language in early 2018 and currently still. I have found that
                        language
                        to be beautiful as well as useful
                        in situations.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently in this bootcamp to learn about web development. Working as an EMT I realized
                        that I
                        enjoy solving puzzels and fixing things, and it's also very clear that the future is tech and I
                        need
                        to
                        hop on board before its too late.
                        A week in and i'm a little lost but catching up everyday and loving every bit of it.<br>
                        <br>
                        My hobbies include spending time with my family, video games, skateboarding, and relaxing. I
                        work
                        hard
                        so my dog can live a happy life.
